To do:

- Advisors should only be able to view courses for students or add courses for students within their department
- staff should be able to edit student data, not just view - FIXED!
- add course DAYS (MW, TR, F to course attributes)
- edit/add student is completed for staff - BUT there is a bug with editing/adding times
- staff should be able to DELETE any student, advisor, instructor, or course within their department


#-------------------------------------------------------------#
In progress:
- add bootstrap classes - DONE (for existing pages)
- advisor needs Department attribute - FIXED






Notes: 
- Add to database
ALTER TABLE Advisors
ADD COLUMN DepartmentID VARCHAR(8),
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_advisors_department FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID);

- Add to database
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD COLUMN Role VARCHAR(20)

-- Insert a sample system administrator user
INSERT INTO Employees (EID, HashPW, Email, FirstName, LastName, Role)
VALUES ('admin001', 'hashed_password_here', 'admin@example.com', 'System', 'Admin', 'system_admin');
