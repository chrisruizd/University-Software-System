To do:

- advisor needs Department attribute
- Advisors should only be able to view courses for students or add courses for students within their department
- staff should be able to edit student data, not just view - FIXED!
- add course DAYS (MW, TR, F to course attributes)
- edit/add student is completed for staff - BUT there is a bug with editing/adding times
- staff should be able to DELETE any student, advisor, instructor, or course within their department
